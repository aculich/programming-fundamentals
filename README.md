programming-fundamentals
------------------------

I'd like to collect here the bare basics for navigating the pitfalls of doing
work in python. At some point, perhaps expanding to R.

Specifically, dealing with multiple interpreters, environments, package
versions, and so on. Specific constructs would include:

 - `PATH`
 - `which`
 - absolute paths
 - Why `./program` (not bare `program`)
 - `#!interpreter` syntax
 - Python environments (`conda`, `virtualenv`/`venv`)

I realize there's probably material in the Software Carpentry repo on this, but
as was once the case with WSGI frameworks, it seems easier to write my own than
to find those materials. I welcome a pointer, however!
