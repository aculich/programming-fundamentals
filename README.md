An intro to the basics that instructors often assume you know, but that you probably never had good instruction on! After this workshop, you should be able to more easily start learning to program (e.g., in our [R or Python Fundamentals Series](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training)), follow instructions and documentation online (e.g., [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)), and communicate better with your collaborators who are programming. If you are just starting out and donâ€™t know which language to learn, or what a programming language even is, this workshop is for you! No prior knowledge expected. This interactive workshop will cover:

1. Navigating the filesystem
2. Common BASH commands
3. A brief, general introduction to the R and Python programming environments

### Technology requirements: 

Please install [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io) (Windows only), [R](https://www.r-project.org), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com), and [Python 3.5 via Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
